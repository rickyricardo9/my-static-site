<img src="5164000-R1-E022.jpeg" alt="A person stands beside  black Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV with the driver door open on a rocky, sandy terrain. The vehicle has a rooftop tent and surfboards secured on top. The license plate reads California 4WVT064 and the rooftop tent cover displays the logo Hannibal Safari Equipment. The environment appears remote and rugged, with rocks and a barren landscape in the background. The scene conveys a sense of adventure and exploration." >
